# frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map
The initial map location is set to Cambridge, MA (my neighborhood). The markers show Thai cuisine places. The list on the right contains all markers shown at the moment.

How to run the app:
Simply open index.html file in your browser and enjoy the app! 

How to use the app:
You enter your neighborhood name (as well as your address or city name) to the input box labeled ‘I live in’. Then enter what type of food you are going to eat in the input box labeled ‘I want to eat’ and click submit button. The map, markers and the list will be updated according to the information you entered. If you click a marker on the map, it will open the inforwindow for the clicked marker. If you click on the place name in the list, the map will zoom it in, and the marker will begin to bounce. 
The list is displayed on the right on large and medium screens, and under the map on mobile and portrait tablet screens. The search panel view will also change according to the device you use.
